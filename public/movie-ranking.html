<h3>Newsies</h3>
<p>Saw this in the movie theatre - it combined the original broadway cast with the touring cast for a cornucopia of dancers! Clapped as if it was live!</p>
<h3>Come From Away</h3>
<p>Only saw pieces of this on Corrine's laptop, but wow!  Definitely one of the best!</p>
<h3>Hamilton</h3>
<p>Haven't seen it yet, but it's on the bucket list for sure!</p>
