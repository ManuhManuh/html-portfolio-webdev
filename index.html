        <h1>Web Dev for the XR Developer</h1>
            <p>
                This is a document of my journey into web development.
                I am attempting to supplement my skills as an XR developer; I believe there 
                is much potential for web based XR, and I want that paint in my palette!
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though I've dabbled before, I'm starting at the beginning 
                to make sure I don't miss anything!
            </p>
